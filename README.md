# Early Stage Diabetes Analysis and Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains a notebook presenting an analysis and prediction of early stage diabetes.

## Dataset
The analysis is conducted using the [*early_stage_diabetes_risk_prediction*]([https://link-url-here.org](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tanshihjen/early-stage-diabetes-risk-prediction)https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tanshihjen/early-stage-diabetes-risk-prediction) dataset from Kaggle. <br>
This dataset comprises 15 categorical variables (binary) and a single numerical variable (Age). The choice of this dataset was motivated by the aim to explore handling categorical variables effectively and employing appropriate tools, such as computing the correlation matrix.

## Libraries and packages
The following libraries and packages were utilized for this project:
* **Plotly Express:** Utilized for creating visually appealing visualizations.<br>
* **Dython:** Employed for computing the correlation matrix. Please refer to the notebook for more details.<br>
* **Pandas:** for data loading and manipulation;<br>
* **Scikit-learn:** for implementing machine learning models and conducting statistical tests (such as chi2 and p-value computations).<br>
